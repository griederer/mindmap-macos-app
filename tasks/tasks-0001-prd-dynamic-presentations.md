## Implementation Notes

### Critical Rules (from PRD)
1. **Animations are slow**: expand (500ms), info (350ms), image (500ms)
2. **Mutual exclusivity**: Info panel and image modal cannot be open simultaneously in presentation mode
3. **Focus mode**: Automatically activates when targeting specific node
4. **Multi-level navigation**: Generate intermediate animations for nested nodes (300ms per level)
5. **Reversible**: All animations must work in reverse for backward navigation
6. **File format**: `.presentation` JSON files stored in `/presentations/` folder
7. **Multiple presentations**: Project can have unlimited presentations
8. **Slide editing**: Only reordering allowed, no content editing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Test each component in isolation (StateEngine, CaptureManager, etc.)
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions (CaptureManager + StateEngine)
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete user workflows (create ‚Üí navigate ‚Üí save)
- **Performance tests**: Verify 60 FPS during animations using Chrome DevTools

### Time Estimates
- **Task 1.0**: ~2 hours (infrastructure setup)
- **Task 2.0**: ~4 hours (core state engine)
- **Task 3.0**: ~5 hours (capture system)
- **Task 4.0**: ~6 hours (animation system)
- **Task 5.0**: ~8 hours (presentation management)
- **Task 6.0**: ~8 hours (UI components)
- **Task 7.0**: ~7 hours (integration & testing)
- **Total**: ~40 hours (1 week full-time or 2 weeks part-time)

**Ready to Start**: Begin with Task 1.1 - Backup current files to temp-clone/

**Remember**:
- Mark each sub-task `[x]` immediately after completion
- Wait for approval after each sub-task before proceeding
- Run tests and show output before marking tasks complete
- Follow TDD: Write test ‚Üí Make it fail (Red) ‚Üí Make it pass (Green) ‚Üí Refactor
