## 🚀 How to Use

### Daily Development

```bash
# Morning - Update develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Start feature
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Work and commit
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
# → Create PR on GitHub: feature/my-new-feature → develop
```

### Testing → Production Flow

```
feature/x → develop → main
     ↓         ↓        ↓
  testing   staging  production
```

**Process:**
1. Develop in `feature/*` branches
2. PR to `develop` for testing
3. When ready, create `release/v5.x.x` from `develop`
4. Final testing in release branch
5. Merge `release/*` to `main` (production)
6. Merge back to `develop`
7. Tag version in `main`

### Quick Release

```bash
# From develop
git checkout -b release/v5.1.0
npm version 5.1.0  # Updates package.json

# Final testing
npm test
npm run build

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/v5.1.0
git tag -a v5.1.0 -m "Release v5.1.0"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v5.1.0
git push origin develop
```
