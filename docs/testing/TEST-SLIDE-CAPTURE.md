# 🧪 Test: Slide Capture Fix

## Test Date
October 7, 2025 - 22:40

## Issue Fixed
**Root Cause:** Script load order - `mindmap-engine.js` loaded AFTER `renderer.js`
**Fix Applied:** Moved `mindmap-engine.js` BEFORE `renderer.js` in index.html

## Script Order (BEFORE - BROKEN):
```html
<script src="renderer.js"></script>
<script src="mindmap-engine.js"></script>
```

## Script Order (AFTER - FIXED):
```html
<script src="mindmap-engine.js"></script>
<script src="animation-engine.js"></script>
<script src="presentation-manager.js"></script>
<script src="presentation-ui.js"></script>
<script src="renderer.js"></script>
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When clicking 📸 Add Slide button:
1. ✅ Slide is captured and stored
2. ✅ Blue notification appears (3 seconds):
   ```
   📸 Slide 1 capturado
   "Cybersecurity Best Practices overview"
   ```
3. ✅ Panel opens automatically (first capture only)
4. ✅ Thumbnail appears in panel
5. ✅ Counter updates: "1 slide"
6. ✅ Present button appears

### Subsequent captures:
1. ✅ Notification appears with slide number
2. ✅ Panel refreshes (doesn't re-open)
3. ✅ New thumbnail added
4. ✅ Counter increments
